    "description":"This sturdy all-brick ranch boasts a well-designed layout. While it has primarily served as a rental property, it's been maintained in excellent condition, and no seller disclosure is required. The entryway features tile flooring, leading to a spacious living room. The large eat-in kitchen offers ample room, with the potential to add a center island, and includes a dining area with a pantry featuring convenient roll-out drawers. All two bedrooms are generously sized, and the master bedroom features a spacious walk-in closet. The kitchen opens onto a patio in the backyard, which offers privacy and features mature trees at the rear property line. The roof is newer, having been replaced in the last few years."
